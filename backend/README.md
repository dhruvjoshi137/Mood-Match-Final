ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **User Prompt:** User inputs a sentence or phrase describing their mood or intent.
2. **Emotion Detection:** A machine learning model analyzes the prompt and predicts the underlying emotion.
3. **Style Mapping:** The detected emotion is mapped to a predefined style guide (JSON) that includes:
   - Fonts
   - Color palettes
   - Image/pattern keywords
4. **Asset Curation:** Relevant images and patterns are pulled from APIs like Unsplash, Pinterest, and Pexels.
5. **Moodboard Assembly:** The elements are placed into a consistent layout template to create a unique, emotion-aligned visual.
